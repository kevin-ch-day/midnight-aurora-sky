    Create a dataset of ocean conditions and save it as 'ocean_conditions_data.csv'.
    The dataset includes 100 samples with 7 features.

    Explanation of the Dataset:
    Sample_ID: Unique identifiers for each sample (S1, S2, ..., S100).
    Temperature_C: Random ocean temperature between 5째C and 30째C.
    Salinity_PPT: Random salinity in parts per thousand (PPT), simulating various oceanic conditions.
    Wave_Height_M: Random wave height ranging from 0.1 meters to 5.0 meters.
    Current_Speed_KPH: Random current speed between 0.5 KPH and 10 KPH.
    Depth_M: Random depth of the ocean measured in meters, between 1 and 100 meters.
    Weather_Condition: Randomly assigned weather conditions, including options like Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, Stormy, and Foggy.

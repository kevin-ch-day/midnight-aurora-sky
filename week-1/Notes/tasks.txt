     - Use `df.isnull().sum()` to quantify missing data.
     - Discuss potential methods for handling missing data (imputation vs. removal).

4. Data Visualization:
   - Visualize distributions and relationships within the data:
     - Create histograms to show distributions (e.g., Salary distribution in employee data).
     - Generate scatter plots to explore relationships (e.g., Salary vs. Age).
     - Create bar plots to compare categories (e.g., Total sales by product category).

5. Correlation Analysis:
   - Compute and visualize the correlation matrix:
     - Use `df.corr()` to analyze relationships between numeric features.
     - Visualize the correlation heatmap to identify strong correlations.

Task III: Python Programming Exercises
----------------------------------------------
1. Data Manipulation Exercises:
   - **Filter Datasets**:
     - Objective: Learn to extract specific subsets of data based on conditions.
     - Actions:
       - Use Pandas to filter employees based on specific criteria, such as department, salary range, or age.
       - Example Code:
         ```python
         engineering_employees = df[df['Department'] == 'Engineering']
         high_salary_employees = df[df['Salary'] > 80000]
         ```
       - Discuss the implications of filtering data and its impact on analysis.

   - **Group and Aggregate Data**:
     - Objective: Understand how to summarize data effectively.
     - Actions:
       - Utilize the `groupby()` function to aggregate data, such as calculating average salary by department or total sales by product category.
       - Example Code:
         ```python
         avg_salary_by_department = df.groupby('Department')['Salary'].mean().reset_index()
         total_sales_by_category = df.groupby('Product_Category')['Total_Sales'].sum().reset_index()
         ```
       - Analyze the results and consider how aggregating data provides insights into organizational structures or sales performance.

   - **Create New Calculated Columns**:
     - Objective: Enhance datasets by adding new, meaningful columns derived from existing data.
     - Actions:
       - Create new columns that represent calculations, such as total sales from quantity sold and sale price, or profit margins.
       - Example Code:
         ```python
         df['Total_Sales'] = df['Quantity_Sold'] * df['Sale_Price']
         df['Profit_Margin'] = (df['Sale_Price'] - df['Cost_Price']) / df['Sale_Price']
         ```
       - Discuss how calculated columns can enhance analysis and provide deeper insights into the data.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - **Conduct EDA to Identify Patterns, Trends, and Anomalies**:
     - Objective: Explore datasets to gain insights and understand underlying trends.
     - Actions:
       - Generate descriptive statistics to summarize the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset’s distribution.
       - Use visualizations to identify patterns (e.g., scatter plots, histograms, box plots).
       - Example Code:
         ```python
         print(df.describe())
         plt.boxplot(df['Salary'])
         plt.title('Box Plot of Employee Salaries')
         plt.show()
         ```
       - Reflect on any anomalies or outliers and their potential impact on the analysis.

   - **Formulate Hypotheses for Further Testing**:
     - Objective: Develop analytical thinking by forming hypotheses based on the findings.
     - Actions:
       - Based on initial analysis and visualizations, formulate hypotheses (e.g., "Employees in the Engineering department earn more than those in Marketing").
       - Design follow-up analyses to test these hypotheses, utilizing statistical methods or further visualizations.
       - Example Hypothesis Testing:
         ```python
         # Compare mean salaries using a t-test
         from scipy import stats
         engineering_salaries = df[df['Department'] == 'Engineering']['Salary']
         marketing_salaries = df[df['Department'] == 'Marketing']['Salary']
         t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(engineering_salaries, marketing_salaries)
         print(f"T-statistic: {t_stat}, P-value: {p_value}")
         ```
       - Discuss the importance of hypothesis testing in data science and how it can validate insights gained from EDA.

# Machine Learning Basics

## 1. Overview of Machine Learning
- **Definition**: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
- **Significance**: As data volumes grow, machine learning plays a crucial role in automating processes and deriving insights across various industries, enhancing decision-making capabilities.

## 2. Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
### A. Supervised Learning
- **Definition**: A type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, meaning that the input data is paired with the correct output.
- **Process**:
  - The model learns to map inputs to outputs based on the training data.
  - Once trained, the model can predict outputs for new, unseen data.
- **Common Algorithms**:
  - Decision Trees: A flowchart-like structure used for classification and regression tasks.
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM): Finds the optimal hyperplane for separating classes in the feature space.
  - Neural Networks: Mimics the human brain to classify and predict data based on learned patterns.
- **Applications**:
  - Spam detection in emails: Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
  - Credit scoring: Predicting the likelihood of loan default based on applicant data.

### B. Unsupervised Learning
- **Definition**: A type of machine learning that deals with unlabelled data, where the model attempts to learn the underlying structure of the data without explicit output labels.
- **Process**:
  - The model identifies patterns and groupings in the data.
- **Common Algorithms**:
  - K-Means Clustering: Partitions data into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity.
  - Hierarchical Clustering: Creates a dendrogram or tree-like structure representing nested groupings.
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces dimensionality of the data while preserving variance.
- **Applications**:
  - Customer segmentation: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.
  - Anomaly detection: Identifying unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior.

## 3. Introduction to Common Algorithms
### A. Decision Trees
- **Description**: A model that uses a tree-like graph of decisions and their possible consequences. It is intuitive and easy to interpret.
- **Usage**: Ideal for both classification and regression tasks, commonly used in business decision-making processes.

### B. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Description**: A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies data points based on the 'K' closest training examples in the feature space.
- **Usage**: Effective for classification tasks and can also be adapted for regression.

## 4. Conclusion
- Understanding the distinctions between supervised and unsupervised learning is fundamental for applying machine learning techniques effectively.
- Familiarity with common algorithms, such as decision trees and KNN, equips practitioners with tools to tackle a variety of data-driven problems.
